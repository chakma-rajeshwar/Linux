To set HOSTNAME use the following command:

vi /etc/hosts

192.168.0.147 loadbalancer  loadbalancer.com
192.168.0.148 backendserver1 backendserver1.com
192.168.0.149 backendserver2  backendserver2.com

To set Static IP using Bridge Connection:


To install net-tools:

sudo yum install net-tools


Before going to set Static IP, select Bridge Connection


To configure Network configuration file

vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens33

TYPE=Ethernet
PROXY_METHOD=none
BROWSER_ONLY=no
BOOTPROTO=none
DEFROUTE=yes
IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=no
IPV6INIT=yes
IPV6_AUTOCONF=yes
IPV6_DEFROUTE=yes
IPV6_FAILURE_FATAL=no
IPV6_ADDR_GEN_MODE=stable-privacy
NAME=ens33
IPADDR=192.168.0.147  # Your desired static IP address
NETMASK=255.255.255.0   # Subnet mask
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1   # Gateway IP address
DNS1=8.8.8.8            # Primary DNS server
DNS2=4.4.4.4            # Secondary DNS server
UUID=your-uuid          # UUID of the interface (optional)
DEVICE=ens33
ONBOOT=yes
PREFIX=24

Note: If someone want to use DHCP connection then BOOTPROTO must be dhcp
GATEWAY IP address is router IP address. IP Address must be similar format with Gateway and Netmask indicates IP Class

Troubleshooting:
To check active internet connectivity: ping google.com
Verify DNS settings:
cat /etc/resolv.conf
If there is need to edit the configuration file, then
vi /etc/resolv.conf
Restart Network Services: systemctl restart network
Flush DNS cache: systemctl restart systemd-resolved
Verify HOST resolution:
nslookup mirrors.fedoraproject.org
ping mirrors.fedoraproject.org
Restart Nework Manager: systemctl restart NetworkManager
Network configuration also perform by using:
nmtui
Then, edit connectivit, active/deactive/delete a connection from the GUI

How to set up a Static IP for a Virtual Machine (CentOS)

On CentOS, you can install and use OpenSSH-server to enable SSH connections to your VM. The OpenSSH server provides the necessary functionality to allow remote access via SSH. To install and enable SSH on CentOS, follow these steps:
1. Install OpenSSH Server:
Run the following command in your terminal to install the OpenSSH server:


sudo yum install openssh-server


2. Start and Enable SSH Service:
After the installation, start the SSH service and enable it to start automatically on system boot:
sudo systemctl start sshd
sudo systemctl enable sshd


3. Firewall Configuration:
If the firewall is enabled on your CentOS VM, you might need to allow SSH traffic through the firewall. Use the following command to allow SSH connections:


sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
